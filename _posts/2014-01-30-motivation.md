After years of using my own CMS built in Ruby Sinatra, Ruby On Rails, plain expressjs, I was always evaluating other frameworks to see if they can help me doing a faster job or if they could just influence my ideas of what a cms framework needs to provide and how it should be implemented. Sailsjs was a real impression to me, but I had to admit, their orm was not ready at that time at all, it was more like a playground, but nothing to play around with in production systems. The most important thing to me was, that sails has a plugin system, but nothing similar to Rails engines. And as I am always building reusable modules like calendar, contact management and such things, it was one of the major things that kept me away from frameworks like sails. caminio is highly modular almost similar to the rails engines concept. And that's the big difference between caminio and these frameworks.
