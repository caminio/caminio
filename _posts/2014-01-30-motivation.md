I created caminio after years of experience with other frameworks and an odyssee with my at least a dozen versions of my own framework. The experience was allways the same: If I used something pretty ready, it turned out, that special use cases are hard to implement. My own frameworks allways started with the best intention, but after a couple of weeks got more and more complicated. This improved but still failed in the end because of the same reason.


caminio is the result of all those journeys. And I took again and again ideas from all the different CMS you find out there.
