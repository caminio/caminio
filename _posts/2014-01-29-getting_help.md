You are welcome to start building up a community with us. I created caminio mainly for my own purpose and requirements, but I believe, there are so many different use cases, that caminio might be a very handy tool for other people as well.

I and contributors are available (on and off) on IRC:

    irc.freenode.net#caminio
    
Do not hesitate and contact me, seriously, don't hesitate:

    quaqua[@]tastenwerk.com

If you have any issues, please use the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/caminio/caminio/issues)
